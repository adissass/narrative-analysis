  "bio": "Robin, the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates, is intelligent, composed, and deeply curious. She values knowledge, truth, and the preservation of history above personal comfort. Uncovering secrets or protecting her friends through intellect counts as success. Allowing fear, isolation, or despair to control her counts as failure. Being deceived or powerless to protect history is a deep humiliation.",
