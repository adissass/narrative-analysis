  "bio": "Buggy, the captain of the Buggy Pirates and current Emperor, is greedy, dramatic, and obsessed with fame. He values recognition and survival more than strength or honor. Gaining attention, wealth, or undeserved power counts as success. Being exposed as weak or losing control of his image counts as failure. Public humiliation or being ignored is catastrophic for his agenda.",
